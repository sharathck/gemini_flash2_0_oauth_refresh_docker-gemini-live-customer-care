#12 1.098 × This environment is externally managed
#12 1.098 ╰─> 
#12 1.098     The system-wide python installation should be maintained using the system
#12 1.098     package manager (apk) only.
#12 1.098     
#12 1.098     If the package in question is not packaged already (and hence installable via
#12 1.098     "apk add py3-somepackage"), please consider installing it inside a virtual
#12 1.098     environment, e.g.:
#12 1.098     
#12 1.098     python3 -m venv /path/to/venv
#12 1.098     . /path/to/venv/bin/activate
#12 1.098     pip install mypackage
#12 1.098     
#12 1.098     To exit the virtual environment, run:
#12 1.098     
#12 1.098     deactivate
#12 1.098     
#12 1.098     The virtual environment is not deleted, and can be re-entered by re-sourcing
#12 1.098     the activate file.
#12 1.098     
#12 1.098     To automatically manage virtual environments, consider using pipx (from the
#12 1.098     pipx package).
#12 1.098 
#12 1.098 note: If you believe this is a mistake, please contact your Python installation or OS distribution provider. You can override this, at the risk of breaking your Python installation or OS, by passing --break-system-packages.
#12 1.098 hint: See PEP 668 for the detailed specification.
